# ShareNote: Online Word Processor ðŸ“„
## Introduction
Good day! 

*Project was built using JavaScript, MongoDB, React, Socket.IO, Quill Editor API.*

ShareNote is a real-time online word processor. This application allows a user to generate, edit, save, and share documents. With the help of Socket.IO, ShareNote allows for document collaboration (co-authoring). Every document is associated with a unique documentId. This approach allows for the seperation of documents. No 2 documents will be the same.  

The text editor was built using the Quill API. Data is managed via MongoDB. Socket.IO handles real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication.

## What is the goal of this project?
This project strengthened my knowledge in React, JavaScript, and real-time communication. But most excitingly, I got to learn MongoDB, Socket.IO, and Quill!
